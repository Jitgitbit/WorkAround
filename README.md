# WorkAround. In both this project and in MessageMixer(Bis), I tried to use JS modules importing and exporting in between JS files locally.
I created the projects on Github, opened in Github desktop, and opened through Github desktop in Visual Studio Code.
I also used ESLint, but that doesn't seem to be a problem.
There is a problem though, communicating between the relevant JS files, because as soon as I export or import, files are not found.
Yet the syntax is correct. To be solved (still a beginner).
